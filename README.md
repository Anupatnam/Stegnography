# Steganography

## Description
This project implements **Steganography**, the technique of hiding secret data (such as text or images) within other digital files (such as images). The goal is to embed data in a cover medium without noticeably altering it, making it undetectable to the human eye.

## Features
- **Encode**: Hide messages or files within an image.
- **Decode**: Extract hidden messages from the image.
- Simple to use with a command-line interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation
- Additional libraries (list any other used libraries like `numpy`, `cv2`, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anupatnam/Stegnography.git
   cd Stegnography
Usage
To encode a message:

python steganography.py -e "message" -i input_image.png -o output_image.png

To decode the message:


python steganography.py -d -i output_image.png
